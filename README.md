# Http Builder NG, The Easy Http Client for Groovy

This fork started off as a way to fix some bugs I had found in the original httpbuilder project. I also had hoped to apply some of the techniques for making ["Modern Groovy DSLs"](https://github.com/dwclark/modern-dsls). In the course of this, the entire codebase was re-written and has grown into an almost 100% re-write. Because of this I decide to rename the main classes and the library itself. Keeping the same name would confuse users of the library and invite questions about why I had broken backwards compatibility with an existing project.

To make the break clean, I have created a new project, [http-builder-ng](https://github.com/dwclark/http-builder-ng), and will be doing all future development there.
